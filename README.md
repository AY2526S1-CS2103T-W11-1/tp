* This is **a software created for NUS CCA Treasurers**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
  * assist CCA treasurers to keep track of finances
  * access member details 
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Treasura_) used for managing CCA finance details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Treasura` because it was initially created to assist CCA treasures in keeping track of finances and member expenses.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see the **[Treasura Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
