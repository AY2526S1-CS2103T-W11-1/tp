# Treasura User Guide

Treasura is a **desktop app for managing CCA members and payments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
If you can type fast, Treasura can get your CCA management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.  
Treasura is primarily targeted towards CCA leaders and treasurers.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Treasura.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar Treasura.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. **Start using Treasura**  
   Type commands into the command box and press **Enter** to execute them.  
   For example, typing `help` and pressing Enter opens the help window.

### Example Commands to Try

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/A0123456X t/friend t/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Treasura.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of more commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `undo`, `list`, `exit`) will return an error if a parameter is given.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `undo 123`, it will cause an error.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
`help` is the one exception to this rule, to provide leeway for unfamiliar users.<br>
</box>

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

---

### Listing archived people: `listarchived`

Format: `listarchived`

* Displays a list of archived members
* Any argument will be disregarded in the command and will return an error.

---

### Undoing an action: `undo`

Undoes the most recent mutating action performed in Treasura.

**Format:** `undo`

- Reverses the **last mutating command** (e.g., state-changing commands such as `add`, `edit`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `addpayment`, `editpayment`, `deletepayment`).
- You can `undo` a `redo` (i.e., undoing reverts the re-applied change).
- Non-mutating commands (e.g., `list`, `find`, `help`, `viewpayment`, `findpayment`) **do not** affect the undo history.

**Examples**
```text
add n/Ali p/91234567 e/ali@example.com m/A1234567X
undo                      ‚Üê removes the person that was just added
archive 1,2,3
undo                      ‚Üê restores the archived members to active
addpayment 1 a/25.00 d/2025-10-21 r/membership
undo                      ‚Üê removes the payment just added
```
---

### Redoing an action: `redo`

Reapplies the most recently undone mutating action.

**Format:** `redo`

* Performs the last change that was previously undone using the `undo` command.
* If a new mutating command (e.g., `add`, `edit`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `addpayment`, `deletepayment`) is executed after an `undo`, the redo history is cleared.  
  This prevents redoing outdated actions after the user starts a new timeline.
* Non-mutating commands (e.g., `list`, `find`, `help`, `viewpayment`, `findpayment`) do **not** affect the redo history.

**Examples**
```text
archive 2
undo                      ‚Üê restores member 2 to the active list
redo                      ‚Üê re-archives member 2 again

addpayment 1 a/50.00 d/2025-10-27
undo
redo                      ‚Üê re-applies the payment of $50.00 for person 1
```

---


### Exiting the Program: `exit`
Closes Treasura.

**Format:**  
`exit`

---

**Tip:**  
For best results, always run `list` or `listarchived` before executing commands that use an **INDEX**.
* Exits the program.
* Any argument will be disregarded in the command and will return an error.


---

### Saving the data

Treasura data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Treasura data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
